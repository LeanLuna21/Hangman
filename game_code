# Let's play hangman
# Tries = 6
# Given a list of words (goal):
##### Generate a random choice from the list of options
##### Show selected word in terms of spaces (nÂ° of letters - low dashes?)
##### Ask the user for to introduce a character (letter-uppercase)
##### Check if the character exists in the goal word
########### If it does -> print letter in correct space (index) --- print all corresponding indexes if letter is repeated
########### If it does not -> show it doesn't and add an x to the count
##### When tries = 0 game is over
